# Compose Multiplatform (Omico flavor)

> [!Important]

> Working in progress. Due to my personal reasons, unable to actively develop. Currently, it is only used to compare source code differences between different versions. For the current progress, please take a look at my [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/Omico/projects/5).

## Introduction
[Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) is great! But it makes me feel painful to use it. I always run into issues with inconsistent API behavior and missing components from time to time. The purpose of creating this project is not to replace the [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform). I hope that through this project (tool), the developers from JetBrains can have a better workspace to compare the differences between different versions of the source code and ensure API consistency. I hope this can solve the problem of omissions caused during the merge process.

For more information, please refer to this issue [JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#4201](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues/4201).

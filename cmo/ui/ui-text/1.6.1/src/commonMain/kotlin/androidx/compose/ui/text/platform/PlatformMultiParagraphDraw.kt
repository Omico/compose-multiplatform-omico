/**
 * Brush is applied to the whole text whether it's MultiParagraph or just Paragraph. However, Brush
 * needs to be realized as a shader before being applied to the text. Applying the same brush
 * separately to each Paragraph in a MultiParagraph violates the unity of the text.
 *
 * This function draws a MultiParagraph with the given brush without repeating the same effect in
 * each Paragraph. Drawing MultiParagraph is expected to be implemented differently in each platform
 * since Shader implementation is also heavily coupled to the underlying platform.

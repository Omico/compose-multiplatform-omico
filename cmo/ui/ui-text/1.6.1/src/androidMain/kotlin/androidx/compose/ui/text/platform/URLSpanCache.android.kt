/**
 * This class converts [UrlAnnotation]s to [URLSpan]s, ensuring that the same instance of [URLSpan]
 * will be returned for every instance of [UrlAnnotation]. This is required for [URLSpan]s (and
 * any ClickableSpan) to be handled correctly by accessibility services, which require every
 * ClickableSpan to have a stable ID across reads from the accessibility node. A11y services convert
 * these spans to parcelable ones, then look them up later using their ID. Since the ID is a hidden
 * property, the only way to satisfy this constraint is to actually use the same [URLSpan] instance
 * every time.
 *
 * See b/253292081.

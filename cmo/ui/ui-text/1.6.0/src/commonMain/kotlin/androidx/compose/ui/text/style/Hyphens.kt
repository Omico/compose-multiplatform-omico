/**
 * Automatic hyphenation configuration.
 *
 * Hyphenation is a dash-like punctuation mark used to join two-words into one or separate
 * syl-lab-les of a word.
 *
 * Automatic hyphenation is added between syllables at appropriate hyphenation points, following
 * language rules.
 *
 * However, user can override automatic break point selection, suggesting line break
 * opportunities (see Suggesting line break opportunities below).
 *
 * Suggesting line break opportunities:
 *
 * - <code>\u2010</code> ("hard" hyphen)
 * Indicates a visible line break opportunity. Even if the line is not actually broken at that
 * point, the hyphen is still rendered.
 *
 * - <code>\u00AD</code> ("soft" hyphen)
 * This character is not rendered visibly; instead, it marks a place where the word can be broken if
 * hyphenation is necessary.
 *
 * The default configuration for [Hyphens] = [Hyphens.None]
 *

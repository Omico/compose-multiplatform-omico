/**
 * Determines the strategy used to render pixels in the blurred result that may extend beyond

 * original content and optionally specified [shape].
 *
 * Sampling of pixels outside of content bounds will have the same value as the pixels at the
 * closest edge.
 * This is recommended for blurring content that does not contain transparent pixels
 * and ensuring the blurred result does not extend beyond the original bounds (ex. blurring
 * an image)
 *
 * @see TileMode.Clamp
 *
 * Alternatively using [BlurredEdgeTreatment.Unbounded] will not clip the blur result to the
 * boundaries of the original content. Sampling of pixels outside of the content bounds
 * will sample transparent black instead.
 * This is recommended for blurring content that is intended to render outside of the
 * original bounds and may contain transparent pixels in the original bounds (ex. blurring
 * an arbitrary shape or text)

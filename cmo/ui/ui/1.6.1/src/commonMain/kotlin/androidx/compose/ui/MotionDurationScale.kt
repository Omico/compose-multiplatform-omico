/**
 * Provides a duration scale for motion such as animations. When the duration [scaleFactor] is 0,
 * the motion will end in the next frame callback. Otherwise, the duration [scaleFactor] will be
 * used as a multiplier to scale the duration of the motion. The larger the scale, the longer the
 * motion will take to finish, and therefore the slower it will be perceived.
 *
 * ## Testing
 *
 * To control the motion duration scale in tests, create an implementation of this interface and
 * pass it to the `effectContext` parameter either where you call `runComposeUiTest` or where you
 * create your test rule.
